# Welcome 
Welcome to my BAP github repository. Here you can find all the datasets and codes I used to create my final project

## Access to my data
Due to GIT not allowing files larger than 25MB to be uploaded on my page, I decided to upload them all onto google drive.

The folder linking to those datasets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ILNDRMT_zPy2FXYuz_hMHGIAQQu-zYhq?usp=drive_link 

## Code explanation 
There are two seperate R scripts listed, one is how I conducted the data cleaning before the merging while the other displays the code behind my random forest.
